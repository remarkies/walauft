# walauft (Currently under heavy development)
Digital Ideation - Studio Web &amp; Mobile, UX, iOS

Digital Ideation project during module called Studio Web & Mobile 2. Goal was to create a website where you could search for club events running today or in the future all around Switzerland. An important feature is the possibility to filter events to a genre of music, so you won't end up in the wrong scene or waste your time checking all the club artists. This app is made in swiss-german, to try out something new. The project duration was around 3 weeks.

The walauft-app part went additionally through another module called Studio User Experience Design Extended. Interviews were made in multiple Iterations to create an user-friendly design. Additonal 3 weeks got invested.

As a next step the project walauft got a native iOS app. The iOS app was developed during the module "Programming for iOS" at HSLU - Informatik.

For all three modules I partnered up with [Dariush Mehdiaraghi](https://github.com/Dariush-Mehdiaraghi). 

This project is running on [walauft.ch](https://www.walauft.ch)
